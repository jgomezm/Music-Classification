I could not figure out how to work with the formatting on the excel. As I see it, these are the primary tasks:

The time are long because they are 1 person weeks, how long it would take one person working on each task. So 2 people on a task will require less time, or separating allows for concurrent tasks.

	1. Collect Data 
		* Write API script: Learning the Spotify API and writing a script that will allow us to collect an arbitrary amount of data
			~ 1 week
				- Necessary first step, cannot be skipped and cannot be concurrent.
		* Collect data: Monitor scraper collecting data
			~ . > 1 week: Depends on amount of data and speed of API, no time limit
				- Requires occasional attention and should be kept in mind but will not require much active engagement while it runs concurrent to other tasks
	2. Data Preprocessing
		* Structure data 
			~ 1 week
				- Can begin immediately after writing API script
		* Augment data
			~ 1 week
				- Can begin immediately after structuring data
	3. Build Network
		* Learn about RNNs: Review literature, examples, and tutorials
			~ > 2 weeks
				- Begins along with overall project
		* Implement Model: Construct a working base model
			~ 2 weeks
				- Concurrent to Learn about RNNs
				- Concurrent to Augment Data
				- Can begin after Structuring data
	4. Iterate
		* Tweak and improve model:
			~ 3 - 4 weeks
				- Final step, will require all the attention we are willing to give it
	5. Train
		* Train model: Train model to convergence
			~ . > 1 week
				- After deciding on an appropriate time to stop iterating
